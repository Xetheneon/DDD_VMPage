LHi, I'm Professor Fiona Polack;
LYou must be the new student, I am the Professor and Head of the School of computer science;
LThis here is the Robert Blackburn Building, where you will be spending a lot of your time;
LThe building was named after Robert Blackburn, an aviation pioneer from Leeds;
LThe building was built <WHEN WAS THE ROBERT BLACKBURN BUILDING BUILT>, and has been a hub for innovation ever since!;
LIf you have any questions, or want to learn more about the staff in the computer science department, come back outside and ask away!;
LI'll leave you to get settled now, feel free to take a stroll through the building now, get familiarised.;
}
What should I do?;
LYou should talk to David, he can help you settle in a bit more, last I saw him was down the main corridor on the first floor of the Robert Blackburn Building;
LI'll see you around;
}
Can you tell me about the staff in the computer science department;
LSure!;
